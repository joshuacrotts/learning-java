\abstract*{In this chapter we begin to introduce the basics of object-oriented programming. We start off simple with small classes that contain only immutable fields. The complexity gradually increases as we mix in mutability and aliasing. This chapter also describes the implementation of several data structures that mimic those from the Collections API, including \ttt{ArrayList}, \ttt{LinkedList}, \ttt{HashSet}, and maps.}
