\section{Object Mutation and Aliasing}
\label{sec:object-mutation-and-aliasing}
A limitation that we have purposefully imposed on our object/class design is the inability to modify the values of instance variables. Value mutation is a foreign concept in some programming languages, but we have made extensive use of it throughout our time in the land of Java. In this section, we will discuss the implications of allowing instance variable mutation and how it can lead to some unexpected behavior.

To access a \ttt{private} instance variable, we design a \ttt{public} accessor method, which returns the instance variable. To modify a \ttt{private} instance variable, we design a \ttt{public} mutator method\index{mutator method}\index{setter method}, which takes in a parameter and assigns the instance variable to the parameter. Let's return to the \ttt{Point} class to demonstrate. Suppose that we instantiate a point $p$ to $(7, 4)$, but we then want to change or modify either coordinate. We can do so by calling the \ttt{setX} or \ttt{setY} methods, respectively. Testing setter methods is important to verify that a change occurred when invoking the setter/mutator method, which we confirm through the accessor method. Another way of phrasing this is that, when testing a mutator, we care about the \emph{side-effect}\index{side-effect} of the method rather than what it returns, namely nothing. Setter methods, or methods that modify outside values or data are definitionally \emph{impure}\index{impure}. Because we want to be able to alter an instance variable, these can no longer be marked as \ttt{final}, so we remove this keyword.\footnote{This is not to suggest that we should never use \ttt{final} instance variables. In fact, we \emph{should} use \ttt{final} instance variables whenever possible, since object mutation introduces the possibility of easy-to-overlook bugs.}

    Point p = new Point(7, 4);
    p.setX(3);

    Point p = new Point(7, 4);

  Point(int x, int y) { 
    this.x = x; 
    this.y = y; 
  }

  int getX() { return this.x; }
  int getY() { return this.y; }
  void setX(int x) { this.x = x; }
  void setY(int y) { this.y = y; }
}
\end{lstlisting}

What are some consequences to mutating an object? One comes through the notion of \emph{object aliasing}. Recall that objects point to references in memory. Therefore if we instantiate a \ttt{Point} $p_1$, then initialize another \ttt{Point} $p_2$ to reference $p_1$, then both objects refer to the same \ttt{Point} instance in memory. If we modify $p_1$ through a setter method, then $p_2$ will reflect the change.

class PointTester {

  @Test
  void testPointAliasing() {
    Point p1 = new Point(7, 4);
    Point p2 = p1;
    p1.setX(3);
    assertAll(
      () -> assertEquals(3, p1.getX()),
      () -> assertEquals(3, p2.getX()),
      () -> assertEquals(p1, p2));
  }

  @Test
  void testSetX() {
    Point p1 = new Point(11, 13);
    Point p2 = p1;
    p2.setX(100);
    assertAll(
      () -> assertEquals(100, p1.getX()),
      () -> assertEquals(100, p2.getX())
      () -> assertEquals(p1, p2));
  }

  @Test
  void testSetY() {
    Point p1 = new Point(7, 4);
    Point p2 = p1;
    p1.setY(2);
    assertAll(
      () -> assertEquals(2, p1.getY()),
      () -> assertEquals(2, p2.getY()),
      () -> assertEquals(p1, p2));
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

This idea carries over to other, more complex classes as well. For example, strings, arrays, lists, and others are all objects, and therefore, they are all subject to object aliasing. Modifying one \ttt{ArrayList} instance will modify all other \ttt{ArrayList} instances that reference the same object. This is a common source of bugs in Java programs, and it is important to be aware of this behavior. In the following example, we will demonstrate aliasing through the \ttt{ArrayList} data structure containing \ttt{Point} objects. We add a series of \ttt{Point} instances to an \ttt{ArrayList}, which is then aliased by another \ttt{ArrayList}. We then add another \ttt{Point} instance to the first \ttt{ArrayList}, followed by a verification that the lists are the same size. Additionally, we traverse over the lists and verify that the elements are the same through the \ttt{==} operator. Remember that \ttt{==} returns whether or not two objects reference the same instance in memory. Because these lists are merely aliases of each other, they will, in fact, contain references to the same \ttt{Point} instances.

class PointTester {

  private final Point P1 = new Point(7, 4);

  @Test
  void testPointArrayListAliasing() {
    List<Point> list1 = new ArrayList<>(List.of(P1, P2, P3));
    List<Point> list2 = list1;
    list1.add(new Point(5, 6));

    // First we can verify that the lists are actually the same.
    assertTrue(list1 == list2);

    // Size testing.
    assertTrue(list1.size() == list2.size());

    // Make sure both lists contain the same elements.
    for (int i = 0; i < list1.size(); i++) {
      assertTrue(list1.get(i) == list2.get(i));
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\myexample{Now that we have classes, mutation, and accessibility, we can finally implement generic data structures such as an \ttt{ArrayList}. In this example we will implement the behavior of the \ttt{ArrayList} data structure, which means we finally understand what is going on under the hood in the Collections API. Let's design a class \ttt{MiniArrayList}, which operates over any type using generics. Like generic static methods, we must quantify the generic type, but unlike static methods, however, we quantify the type over the class declaration, meaning that all instance and static methods observe/respect the quantifier and do not need to be separately quantified.}

In addition to the class header, what else does an \ttt{ArrayList} store? A backing array of elements and its corresponding length, of course! The array, as we described in Chapter~\ref{chapter-arrays-collections}, dynamically resizes as we add or insert elements. The logical size of the array, i.e., the number of presently-existing elements, is stored in \ttt{size}, whereas the current capacity, i.e., how many elements can currently be stored without a resize, is stored in \ttt{capacity}. 

Our class will provide two constructors: one that instantiates the backing array to store ten elements, and another that allows the user to specify. Interestingly, this shows off a great example of one constructor calling another of the same class, an idea called \emph{constructor chaining}. ``Ten,'' however, is a magic number: a number whose context is the only thing that determines its meaning. So, let's refactor it into a constant class variable with an identifier.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
class MiniArrayList<T> {

  private static final int DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 10;

  private T[] elements;
  private int size;
  private int capacity;

  MiniArrayList() { 
    this(DEFAULT_CAPACITY); 
  }

  MiniArrayList(int capacity) {
    this.size = 0;
    this.capacity = capacity;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that we declare an array of type \ttt{T} to store the elements of our mini array list. We now must instantiate the array inside the second constructor. 
The problem we immediately encounter is that we cannot instantiate an array of a generic type, because Java arrays utilize runtime information about the element type. 
Generics, on the other hand, are a compile-time feature, meaning it is impossible to directly instantiate an array of a generic type. 
Instead, we must instantiate an array containing (elements of) type \ttt{Object}, followed by a cast to contain (elements of) type \ttt{T}.\footnote{To be pedantic, the array is of type \ttt{Object[]}, and we cast it to type \ttt{T[]}.} 
This is called an \emph{unchecked cast}, and it is a necessary evil in Java to support powerful classes that operate over generic arrays.

% %\enlargethispage{9\baselineskip}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
class MiniArrayList<T> {

  private static final int DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 10;

  private T[] vals;
  private int size;
  private int capacity;

  MiniArrayList() { 
    this(DEFAULT_CAPACITY); 
  }

  MiniArrayList(int capacity) {
    this.size = 0;
    this.capacity = capacity;
    this.vals = (T[]) new Object[this.capacity];
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

We now need to implement the \ttt{add} method, which adds an element to the end of the array list. We first check if the array is full, and if so, we resize the array. We then add the element to the end of the array and increment the size. Resizing the array is, fortunately, not complicated; all we need to do is instantiate a new, larger array, copy the existing elements over, then reassign the instance variable. The question now is, by what factor should the array capacity increase? This decision is implementation-dependent, but we will use a doubling factor out of convenience.\footnote{Another logical choice is to increase the capacity linearly based on the default capacity. This choice removes the need for an extra static variable.} We make \ttt{resize} private because it is an implementation detail that the programmer who uses \ttt{MiniArrayList} should not concern themselves over. 

To write coherent tests, we should also write the \ttt{get} method, which returns the element at a given index, as well as \ttt{size}, which returns the number of logical elements in the list. 
For now, we will not worry about bounds checking, but we will return to this in a later chapter on exceptions.

      newArray[i] = this.vals[i]; 
    }
    this.vals = newArray;
 }
}
\end{lstlisting}

We will write two more methods: \ttt{insert} and \ttt{remove}, which inserts an element $e$ at a given index $i$, and removes an element $e$ respectively. These two methods are similar in that they alter the backing array by shifting its values right and left. Accordingly, our implementation will contain the private helper methods \ttt{shiftRight} and \ttt{shiftLeft}. If we attempt to insert an element into a list that must be resized, we call \ttt{resize}. Both \ttt{insert} and \ttt{remove} warrant test cases! Like the \ttt{get} counterpart, neither of these new methods will perform bounds checking, so testing out-of-bounds behavior, for the time being, is not pertinent.

\myexample{Let's see a few more examples of object aliasing and mutation. These examples will not be meaningful in what they represent, but are great exercises in testing your understanding. We will create five classes: \ttt{A}, \ttt{B}, \ttt{C}, \ttt{D}, and \ttt{E}. Class \ttt{A} contains one mutable string instance variable; its constructor assigns the instance variable to the parameter thereof. Classes \ttt{B} and \ttt{C} are identical aside from the name: they contain an immutable object of type \ttt{A} as an instance variable. Class \ttt{D} stores an integer array of ten elements. Finally, class \ttt{E} stores a mutable integer as an instance variable.}

We present several test cases that assert different pieces of these classes. We will analyze each one and determine why it uses either \ttt{assertEquals} or \ttt{assertNotEquals} in its comparison. Our first series of tests only focuses on classes \ttt{A}, \ttt{B}, and \ttt{C} to keep things simple. We insert blanks in the assertion statements for you to fill in as exercise before checking your answers.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
import static Assertions.assertEquals;
import static Assertions.assertNotEquals;

class ClassTester {

  @Test
  void testOne() {
    final A a = new A("Hello!");
    B b = new B(a);
    C c = new C(a);
    assert______(b.getA(), c.getA());
    assert______(b.getA().getS(), c.getA().getS());
    a.setS("Hi!");
    assert______(b.getA().getS(), c.getA().getS());
    b.getA().setS("howdy!");
    assert______(b.getA().getS(), c.getA().getS());
    B b2 = new B(a);
    assert______(a, b2.getA());
    assert______(b, b2);
    b = b2;
    assert______(a, b.getA());
    assert______(b, b2);
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

To set the scene, we first declare \ttt{a} as an immutable instance of \ttt{A} with the string literal \ttt{"Hello!"}. Then, we instantiate objects \ttt{b} and \ttt{c} of types \ttt{B} and \ttt{C} respectively, each receiving \ttt{a} as an argument to their constructors. 

Comparing \ttt{b.getA()} against \ttt{c.getA()} is a comparison of two references to the same object. Because \ttt{a} is immutable, we cannot change its value, so both \ttt{b} and \ttt{c} will always refer to the same object. Therefore, we use \ttt{assertEquals} to compare the two references. In particular, passing \ttt{a} to both constructors passes a reference to the same object.

\begin{figure}[htp!]

\begin{tikzpicture}
  % Object a
  \node[rectangle, draw] (a) {\texttt{a = 0xffff2345}};

  \node[above left=of a,on grid,align=left] (b) {\texttt{B b = new B(a);}\\\texttt{b.getA();}};

  % Equality Check Illustration (optional)
  % ... (Can be an inset showing assertEquals usage)
\end{tikzpicture}
\label{fig:memoryref}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:memoryref}, we use memory addresses to refer to the location of \ttt{a}. To be a bit pedantic, objects are not stored directly in system memory per se, but rather a location accessible by the Java Virtual Machine.

Comparing \ttt{b.getA().getS()} against \ttt{c.getA().getS()} is a comparison of two references to the same object, similar to the previous problem, right? Wrong! Recall that the \ttt{String} class overrides the \ttt{equals} method implementation to compare strings for their content rather than their reference. Should we choose to compare the two strings for referential equality, we must use the \ttt{==} operator. In this case, we use \ttt{assertEquals} since the two strings are equal in content, but using \ttt{==} would also work because the strings are also equal in reference.

In the third line we change the value of the string inside \ttt{a} to be \ttt{"Hi!"}, which updates across all instances that point to \ttt{a}. Therefore, rerunning the same comparison as before still results in a true equality.

In the fifth line, we retrieve the \ttt{A} object instance pointed to by \ttt{B} and change its underlying string to be \ttt{"Howdy!"}. Rerunning the same test as before yet again results in a true equality. Because \ttt{b} points to the same \ttt{a} that \ttt{c} references, this change propagates across all references to \ttt{a}, even if we do not directly modify \ttt{a}.

We then declare a new instance of \ttt{B} named \ttt{b2}, which references the same \ttt{a} as before. If we check the value of \ttt{a} against the value of \ttt{a} inside \ttt{b2}, we of course get a true equality.

We immediately follow this comparison with one in which we compare \ttt{b} to \ttt{b2}. Because these are completely distinct object instantiations, the equality does not hold true.

Up next we reassign \ttt{b} to point to \ttt{b2}. This is a reassignment of a reference, not a reassignment of an object. Therefore if we check \ttt{b} against \ttt{b2} for equality, it is now trivially true.

\myexample{Let's do another aliasing test, this time to involve arrays of objects. We will operate over a class \ttt{E} that stores a single number, similar to how the \ttt{Integer} class works.}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
class E {

  private int val;

  E(int v) { this.val = v; }

  int getNumber() { return this.val; }

  void setNumber(int v) { this.val = v; }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
import static Assertions.assertEquals;
import static Assertions.assertNotEquals;

class ClassTester {

  @Test
  void testTwo() {
    E e = new E(42);
    E[] arrOfE = new E[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < arrOfE.length; i++) { arrOfE[i] = new E(i); }
    assert______(arrOfE[2], arrOfE[5]);
    assert______(arrOfE[2].getNumber(), arrOfE[5].getNumber());

    for (int i = 0; i < arrOfE.length; i++) { arrOfE[i] = e; }
    assert______(arrOfE[0], arrOfE[2]);
    assert______(arrOfE[0].getNumber(), arrOfE[2].getNumber());
    arrOfE[7].setNumber(102);
    assert______(arrOfE[0].getNumber(), arrOfE[2].getNumber());
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The object \ttt{e} is instantiated to a new instance of \ttt{E}, which receives the integer \ttt{42} as an argument to the constructor. Thereafter we instantiate an array of ten \ttt{E} objects. The following loop then instantiates each index of the array to a new, distinct \ttt{E} object with the integer \ttt{i} as an argument to the constructor.

So, what happens if we compare any arbitrary element $e$ against any other arbitrary element $e'$ such that $e \neq e'$? Because they are all instantiated to distinct instances of \ttt{E}, any equality comparison is false. We can extend this to retrieving the number inside each \ttt{E} object and comparing them. Because they are all distinct objects, and each \ttt{E} instance receives a different number, the equality is false.

The second for loop assigns each index of the array to the \ttt{e} object. 
Then, we can compare any arbitrary element against any other arbitrary element, and they will always be equal, since every element is a reference to the same memory reference. 
Thus, if we set the number of one arbitrary element, this change propagates to every other element in the list, because again, all references point to the same object.
Preceding the final assertion is an assignment of a new \ttt{E} instance to index four to box the integer~$2$. 
Changing any other index modifies \ttt{e}, but does not modify the instance of \ttt{E} at index four; the converse of which also holds.

\myexample{Let's get even more practice with aliasing over arrays. Suppose we have the following code segment:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
class ArrayAliasingTester {

  static int baz(int[] A) {
    A[3] = 42;
    return A[3];
  }

  static int modify(int[] A) {
    A = new int[100];
  }

  @Test
  void testBaz() {
    int[] A = new int[]{0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    A[2] = baz(A);
    assertEquals(84, A[2] + A[3]);

    int[] B = new int[]{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    int[] C = B;
    assert______(84, C[3] + baz(B));

    int[] D = new int[]{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    int[] E = D;
    int res = baz(E);
    assert______(84, D[3] + res);  
    D = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    assert______(E, D);  

    int[] F = new int[]{0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    int h1 = F.hashCode();
    modify(F);
    assertEquals(h1, F.hashCode());
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Again, we encourage the readers to stop and think about what kinds of assertions to fill in the blanks. Consider what happens when arrays are passed to methods, then continue on to check your understanding.

We start by examining the \ttt{baz} method, which receives an array of integers~$A$, overwrites the value at index $3$ to be~$42$, then returns that element. 

Inside the JUnit tester method, we first instantiate an array $A$ to contain five zeroes. Afterwards, we assign, to index 2 of $A$, the value of invoking \ttt{baz(A)}, meaning \ttt{A[2]} is $42$, but so is \ttt{A[3]}, because passing an array to a method passes a copy of the reference to the array. Therefore, the value of the passed array is mutated. We assert whether or not the sum of these two elements is $84$, which is true because $42+42=84$.

Second, we instantiate an array~$B$ to contain six zeroes. This is followed by an initialization of an array~$C$ to point to~$B$, meaning~$C$ is an alias for~$B$. We then assert whether or not the sum of \ttt{C[3]} and \ttt{baz(B)} is~$84$. The answer relies on an understanding of evaluation order. The plus operator evaluates its arguments from left-to-right. So, before invoking \ttt{baz(B)}, the value of \ttt{C[3]} is zero, so the left-hand side of the addition is zero. Immediately after, we evaluate \ttt{baz(B)}, which mutates not only index $3$ of $B$, but also index $3$ of $C$, because again, $C$ aliases~$B$. The expression now becomes an addition of $0$ and $42$, which is certainly not equal to~$84$.

Third, we instantiate yet another array $E$ to contain seven zeroes. We then alias the array $D$ to~$E$, followed by a call to \ttt{baz(E)}, whose result is stored in the \ttt{res} variable. We know for certain that \ttt{res} contains \ttt{42}, and we want to know whether \ttt{D[3]} also contains $42$ to sum to the expected value of $84$. Because $D$ aliases~$E$, it must be the case that \ttt{D[3]} is also $42$, meaning we assert equals.

The fourth assertion is the result of altering $D$'s reference. Recall that it initially references the new integer array of seven zeroes. The~$D$ array becomes an alias to~$E$, which might suggest that changing $E$ also changes what $D$ points to, but this is not the case. When we instantiate~$E$ to point to the new array of the integers from 1 to 7, $D$ remains aliased to the array of seven zeroes that $E$ was instantiated to. Therefore, the assertion should be not equals.

Finally, we instantiate an array~$F$ to contain the integers from~$0$ to~$4$ inclusive. We then compute the hash code of~$F$ and store it inside~$h_1$. Then, we pass~$F$ to the \ttt{modify} method, which appears to modify the passed reference to point to a new array. In the previous chapter we mentioned ``pass by pseudo-reference,'' which alluded to this problem. When we pass an object to a method, we pass a copy \emph{of} the reference and not the reference itself. This means that changing what the copy points to does not change the reference made outside the method. So, we should assert equals on~$h_1$ and the hash code of~$F$ after invoking \ttt{modify}, since~$F$'s reference is never altered.

\myexample{Some readers may question why we emphasize mutation and aliasing. When working with the Collections API and designing data structures, proper care must be taken to avoid undesired behavior and outcomes. Consider what happens if we design a class \ttt{F} that stores a reference to a \ttt{List<Integer>} as an instance variable. Then, suppose we instantiate two distinct instances of \ttt{F}, namely $f_1$ and $f_2$, each of which receive the same list of numbers. If we then mutate the list somewhere inside of $f_1$, then the list stored as a reference inside $f_2$ is also changed.}

\myexample{Recall the \ttt{LinkedList} class from Chapter~\ref{chapter-arrays-collections}. If you have ever wondered how it works under the hood, now is the time to find out! We will design a \emph{doubly-linked list} data structure that stores arbitrarily-typed elements.}

First, remember the structure of a linked list: they are composed of nodes, which hold the data and a pointer to the next element in the chain/sequence. These types of linked lists are \emph{singly-linked}, because nodes only refer to the successive element. In contrast, our class models a doubly-linked list, since its nodes point to their predecessor and their successor. 

We need a generic class that stores references to the first and last elements of the list. Let's create the \ttt{DoublyLinkedList} class to receive a type parameter \ttt{T} and store the first and last nodes as instance variables. It's important to realize that, whoever uses this class will not be exposed to the innards of the class, i.e., how the links are established/constructed/altered/removed. We wish to preserve the idea of encapsulation, after all.

We run into an eminent problem when declaring the types of the instance variables: what should they be? We need to design a class that encapsulates the value of the node, and holds references to its previous and successor nodes. Some programmers may consider designing a separate \ttt{.java} file for this class, but remember the encapsulation methodology: nobody outside of this class should even be aware that nodes exist in the first place. So, we can create a private and static \ttt{Node<T>} class, which is local to the definition of \ttt{DoublyLinkedList}. A privatized class can only ever be static, because it is nonsense to say that a private class definition belongs to an arbitrary instance of the class in which it resides.\footnote{Such a claim would imply that every instance of the \ttt{DoublyLinkedList} class would carry the data for instantiating nodes, which is wasteful.} We also override the \ttt{toString} to output the underlying stringified data of the node.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
class DoublyLinkedList<T> {

  private static class Node<T> {

    private T value;
    private Node<T> prev;
    private Node<T> next;

    private Node(T value) { 
      this.value = value; 
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
      return this.value.toString();
    }
  }

  private Node<T> head;
  private Node<T> tail;

  DoublyLinkedList() {
    this.last = this.first = null;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that, in the constructor of \ttt{DoublyLinkedList}, we assign the first and last references to each other, which both point to \ttt{null}. This is because, when the list is empty, there is no first or last element.

To test the methods that we are about to design, we will override the \ttt{toString} method (of \ttt{DoublyLinkedList}) to print the elements inside brackets, separated by commas and a space. To traverse over the list, however, we should use a custom-defined \ttt{Iterator}, which will be its own localized class definition. We have seen iterators before, but until now we have not implemented one on our own. The idea is, fortunately, very simple: we keep track of the current node, and upon calling \ttt{hasNext}, we return whether or not the node is \ttt{null}. Similarly, invoking \ttt{next} returns the value of the stored node and moves the pointer forward via the ``next'' instance. Finally, we create the \ttt{.iterator} method, which returns an instance of the iterator superclass. We do not want to expose how this particular iterator works, because the caller does not need to be aware of this logic; they are only concerned with iterating over the structure, in this case, a doubly-linked list.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
import java.util.Iterator;

class DoublyLinkedList<T> {
  // ... previous code not shown.

  Iterator<T> iterator() {
    return new DoublyLinkedListIterator<>(this.first);
  }

  private static class DoublyLLIterator<T> implements Iterator<T> {
    
    private Node<T> current;

    private DoublyLLIterator(Node<T> first) {
      this.current = first;
    }

    @Override
    boolean hasNext() { 
      return this.current != null; 
    }

    @Override
    T next() {
      T value = this.current.value;
      this.current = this.current.next;
      return value;
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Using the iterator in \ttt{toString} is straightforward: we have a while loop that continues until no more elements are present. We complete two tasks at the same time by having an iterator, which then makes subsequent traversals over the list easier.

Now we can write methods to add, retrieve, and remove elements from the list. To add an elemenet, we need to take the links of \ttt{first} and \ttt{last}, and reassign them accordingly to remain consistent with our doubly-linked list property. If the list is empty, then we just have to assign the new node $n$ to both the \ttt{first} and \ttt{last} references. Otherwise, we set the ``next'' pointer of \ttt{last} to $n$, and set the ``previous'' pointer of $n$ to \ttt{last}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
import static Assertions.assertAll;

      () -> list.add(4),
      () -> list.add(1),
      () -> list.add(5),
      () -> assertEquals("[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5]", list.toString()));
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
class DoublyLinkedList<T> {
  // ... previous code not shown.

  /**
  * Adds a new node to the end of the list.
  * @param data - The data to be stored in the new node.
  */
  void add(T data) {
    Node<T> newNode = new Node<>(data);

    // If the list is empty, make the new node the first and last node.
    if (this.first == null) {
      this.first = newNode;
    } else {
      // Otherwise, add the new node to the end of the list.
      newNode.prev = this.last;
      this.last.next = newNode;
    }
    this.last = newNode;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Retrieving an element is trivial, as it's just a matter of traversing over the list and returning the data at the index of a node. If the index is out of bounds, we return an empty \ttt{Optional}.\footnote{It is, in general, a better idea to use exceptions, but we have not covered them yet.}

  Optional<T> get(int idx) {

Finally we arrive at element removal, which is not as cut-and-dry. We want to pass the element-to-remove (compared via \ttt{equals}), but we need to adjust the pointers accordingly. In particular, there are four cases to consider:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item If the element-to-remove $e$ is the first of the list, then its successor is now the first. Its previous pointer is adjusted to now point to \ttt{null}.
  \item If the element-to-remove $e$ is the last of the list, then its predecessor is now the last. Its next pointer is adjusted to now point to \ttt{null}.
  \item If the element to remove $e$ is neither the first nor the last, we retrieve its previous node $p$, its next node $n$, and assign $p_\emph{next} = n$, and $n_\emph{prev} = p$. This, in effect, ``delinks'' $e$ from the list, which gets consumed by the garbage collector.
  \item If the element-to-remove $e$ is not in the list, do nothing.
\end{enumerate}

\myexample{Some programming languages do not come standard with data structures such as \ttt{Map} or, if they do, they are cumbersome to utilize. A substitute for the common mapping data structure is called an \emph{association list}, originating with the Lisp programming language. Its desired purpose is nearly identical to that of a map, but with worse performance implications. In this example we will design such a structure, as if \ttt{Map} did not exist in Java.}

Associations lists, as their name implies, associate values to other values, just like a map. In dynamically-typed languages, e.g., Scheme, association lists accept any type as their key and any type as their value. Therefore, we could have an association list that maps a string to an integer, or an integer to a list of strings, and so on. Should we want to use truly arbitrary types in the list, we can assign \ttt{Object} to both key and value types.

Our association list will support several methods that are related to their functional programming eqiuvalents. In particular, we want a \ttt{lookup} method to retrieve the associated value of some element and an an \ttt{extend} method to add a new association. Note that the \ttt{extend} method will, rather than modifying the current association list, return a new association list with the new association added. This is because we want to preserve the idea of immutability, which is a common theme in functoinal programming. Association lists, therefore, need to have a ``parent'' pointer to keep track of those associations in the list that we extend from.\footnote{In the next section on abstract classes and interpreters, we will revisit this idea in greater detail.} We will also override the \ttt{toString} method to print the associations in a readable format.

Each association list in our representation stores exactly one association. Each time we extend the association, we create a new list that points to the previous list. This is a very inefficient way to store associations, but it is a common functional way of extending bindings in a programming language, most often in simple interpreted languages.
