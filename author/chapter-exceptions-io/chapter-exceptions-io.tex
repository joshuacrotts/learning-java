\abstract*{With the foundations of Java, data structures, and classes/objects covered, we now move into more advanced topics, such as exception handling and I/O.  This chapter will discuss unchecked and checked exceptions, as well as how to handle them. We will also discuss several means of working with file I/O, including more advanced topics such as serialization. Finally, the chapter ends with an explanation of more modern Java I/O techniques.}
