\extrachap{Acknowledgements}

I piloted \emph{Learning Java} on the students in the Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 semesters of CSCI-C 212 (Introduction to Software Systems) at Indiana University. The inspiration came from those in the former, which drove me to continue writing and designing exercises. I sincerely appreciate all of the comments, suggestions, and corrections made. The following students and course staff members found mistakes: Ashley Won, Daniel Yang, Jack Liang, Shyam Makwana, and Muazzam Siddiqui.
