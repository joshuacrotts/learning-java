\abstract*{This chapter introduces readers to how we analyze algorithm performance through asymptotic analysis. We will discuss Big-Oh, Big-Omega, and Theta notation, as well as the best, average, and worst-case analysis of algorithms. We then use these tools to analyze the performance of the searching and sorting algorithms discussed in~\Cref{chapter-searching-sorting}.}
