\abstract*{This section is divided into two parts. In the first, we discuss the two popular searching algorithms: linear and binary search. In the second part, we describe the five most popular sorting algorithms: bubble, selection, insertion, merge, and quick sort. All algorithms are implemented using generics with a functional and in-place approach.}
