\section{Tree-Based Data Structures}
At the start of this section, we distinguished between three types of data structures: array-based, dictionary-based, and set-based. To close off this part of the chapter, we will dive into a more advanced data structure category: tree-based structures.

A \emph{tree} is a recursive data structure by nature. Trees are comprised of \emph{nodes} and \emph{edges} between nodes. Let's draw a simple tree that stores some arbitrary numbers.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[level distance=1.5cm,
  level 1/.style={sibling distance=3cm},
  level 2/.style={sibling distance=1.5cm}]
  \node {7}
    child {node {3}
      child {node {1}}
      child {node {6}}
    }
    child {node {42}
      child {node {15}
        child {node {26}}
      }
      child {node {84}}
    };
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Caption for the binary tree.}
\label{fig:binarytree}
\end{figure}

The example in Figure~\ref{fig:binarytree} is called a \emph{binary tree} because all nodes have at most two children. 
The top-most node in the tree, $7$ is called the \emph{root}, which has two children that are trees themselves $3$ and $41$. 
The root has a depth of zero, whereas $3$ and $41$ have depth of one. 
A node $m$ is a child of node $a$ if there is a direct edge between $a$ and $m$, where the depth level of $a$ is exactly one fewer than $m$'s depth level. 
We consider a node $m$ to be a descendant of node $a$ if there is a sequence of edges from $a$ to $m$, where the depth level of $a$ is at least one fewer than $m$'s depth level. 
The \emph{height} of a tree $T$ is the maximum of the depth of $T$'s root and its children. 
In the example, the tree's height is three due to the path from $7$ to $26$.

At this point the reader may await us to show them a collections API implementation of a tree. 
Unfortunately, Java provides no implementation of trees in its collections API. 
To compensate, we provide a library that mimics what Java might provide. In this library we include the \ttt{BinarySearchTree} class, alongside a few other tree implementations that are more complex. 
The difference between a binary search tree and a standard binary tree is that the elements are ordered. 
All nodes to the left of a node $T$ are ``less than'' $T$, whereas all nodes to the right of $T$ are greater than $T$.
The tree example from Figure~\ref{fig:binarytree} is, coincidentally, a binary search tree.

To create a binary search tree with our API, we can declare an object of type \ttt{Tree}, then instantiate it as a \ttt{BinarySearchTree}. 
Similar to how \ttt{ArrayList} and \ttt{LinkedList} are ``kinds of'' \ttt{List} objects, a \ttt{BinarySearchTree} is a ``kind of'' \ttt{Tree} object.
To add an element to the binary search tree, we invoke the \ttt{add} method. 
Nodes are inserted according to their natural ordering if a \ttt{Comparator} is not specified when instantiating the tree, identical to priority queues.

\example{To visit the elements of a binary tree, we can write one of three methods: \ttt{preorderTraversal}, \ttt{inorderTraversal}, or \ttt{postorderTraversal}.}
All three traversal types are recursive by design.
\begin{itemize}
  \item A \emph{preorder traversal} visits the current node, then recurses on its left child, then recurses on its right child.
  \item An \emph{inorder traversal} recurses on its left child, then visits the current node, then recurses on its right child.
  \item A \emph{postorder traversal} recurses on its left child, then recurses on its right child, then visits the current node.
\end{itemize}

Let's design the \ttt{List<T> inorderTraversal(Tree<T> t)} method, which returns a list of the elements in the tree after an inorder traversal. An interesting property of this traversal is that it always visits the elements in sorted order (according to the natural ordering or the comparator). To make testing this method easier, we will take advantage of the fact that we can pass a list of values to the \ttt{BinarySearchTree} constructor, which "bulk adds" them to the tree.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
import static Assertions.assertAll;
import static Assertions.assertEquals;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import teachingjava.trees.Tree;
import teachingjava.trees.BinarySearchTree;

class InorderTraversalTester {

  @Test
  void testInorderTraversal() {
    Tree<Integer> t1 = new BinarySearchTree<>();
    Tree<Integer> t2 = new BinarySearchTree<>(List.of(7, 3, 42, 1, 6, 15, 84, 26));
    assertAll(
      () -> assertEquals(List.of(), inorderTraversal(t1));
      () -> assertEquals(List.of(1, 3, 6, 7, 15, 26, 42, 84), inorderTraversal(t2)));
  }
}

\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import teachingjava.trees.Tree;
import teachingjava.trees.BinarySearchTree;

class InorderTraversal {

  /**
   *
   * @param
   * @return
   */
  static <T> List<T> inorderTraversal(Tree<T> t) {
    if (t.isEmpty()) {
      return new ArrayList<>();
    } else {
      List<T> left = inorderTraversal(t.getLeft());
      List<T> right = inorderTraversal(t.getRight());
      List<T> res = new ArrayList<>();
      res.addAll(left);
      res.add(t.getValue());
      res.addAll(right);
      return res;
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

A tree is said to be \emph{balanced} if the heights of its left and right children differ by at most one.
This property allows for very fast object lookup times, insertions, and removals. 
Maintaining the balance factor of a tree is a non-trivial task, though, and the \ttt{BinarySearchTree} class does not balance the tree, meaning the fast operation times are not guaranteed.
In fact, these operations are, in their worst case, the same as a linked list, because the shape of a \emph{totally unbalanced} binary search tree resembles a list. 
By ``totally unbalanced,'' we mean that all elements are to the left or right of the root, a property that applies recursively to its children.

\example{Let's write the \ttt{findMax} method that finds the largest element of a binary search tree. All this involves is following the right-most child until we reach a dead-end. Because all elements to the right of another are larger than the node, this task is trivial.}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
import static Assertions.assertEquals;
import static Assertions.assertAll;

import java.util.List;
import teachingjava.trees.Tree;
import teachingjava.trees.BinarySearchTree;

class FindMaxTester {

  @Test
  void testFindMax() {
    Tree<Integer> t1 = new BinarySearchTree<>();
    Tree<Integer> t2 = new BinarySearchTree<>(List.of(7, 3, 42, 1, 6, 15, 84, 26));
    assertAll(
      () -> assertEquals(null, findMax(t1));
      () -> assertEquals(84, findMax(t2)));
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
import teachingjava.trees.Tree;
import teachingjava.trees.BinarySearchTree;

class FindMax {

  /**
   * Finds the maximum value in a tree.
   * @param t - the tree to search.
   * @return the maximum value in the tree, or null if the tree is empty.
   */
  static <T> T findMax(Tree<T> t) {
    if (t.isEmpty()) {
      return null;
    } else if (t.getRight().isEmpty()) {
      return t.getValue();
    } else {
      return findMax(t.getRight());
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\example{Let's design the \ttt{boolean isBalanced(Tree t)} method to determine whether or not a tree is balanced.} As we stated, a tree is balanced if the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most one. The idea is to recursively traverse each subtree until we reach a leaf, at which we know that the tree is balanced. We then compare the heights of the left and right subtrees, and if they differ by more than one, we return \ttt{false}. Because we use a logical \ttt{AND} operator, if any subtree is unbalanced, the entire tree is unbalanced, because the \ttt{false} return value propagates upward.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
import static Assertions.assertTrue;
import static Assertions.assertFalse;
import static Assertions.assertAll;

import java.util.List;
import teachingjava.trees.Tree;
import teachingjava.trees.BinarySearchTree;

class IsBalancedTester {

  @Test
  void testIsBalanced() {
    Tree<Integer> t1 = new BinarySearchTree<>();
    Tree<Integer> t2 = new BinarySearchTree<>(List.of(7, 3, 42, 1, 6, 15, 84, 26));
    Tree<Integer> t3 = new BinarySearchTree<>(List.of(10, 5, 20));
    assertAll(
      () -> assertTrue(isBalanced(t1));
      () -> assertFalse(isBalanced(t2)),
      () -> assertTrue(isBalanced(t3)));
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=MyJava]
import teachingjava.trees.Tree;
import teachingjava.trees.BinarySearchTree;

class IsBalanced {

  /**
   * Determines whether a tree is balanced. A tree is balanced if the difference
   * between the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most one.
   * @param t - the tree to check.
   * @return true if the tree is balanced, false otherwise.
   */
  static boolean isBalanced(Tree t) {
    if (t.isEmpty()) {
      return true;
    } else {
      boolean left = isBalanced(t.getLeft());
      boolean right = isBalanced(t.getRight());
      int leftHeight = t.getLeft().height();
      int rightHeight = t.getRight().height();
      return left && right && Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) <= 1;
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Maintaining a balanced binary tree, as we suggested earlier, guarantees fast operations. 
This invariant is non-trivial to maintain, and there are several \emph{height-balancing} tree data structures that do so. For example, there are \emph{AVL} trees, \emph{red-black} trees, and \emph{splay} trees (the list is by no means exhaustive). We end our discussion on trees here, but we will revisit them in a subsequent chapter on advanced object-oriented programming, where their practicality becomes more apparent.
